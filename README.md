# Predicting-likelihood-to-make-repeat-purchase

The objective of this is to:
i.) get an understanding of the value of customers based on the marketing channel they came from- this would presumably give the company insights regarding which marketing channels appear to bring in the most value adding customers
ii.) get an understanding of the median time (in hours) it takes to complete an order from the moment a customer makes an order till the point at which the customer indicates receiving said order by city
iii.) using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a given customer making a repeat purchase based on the size of their order, the review they gave after their first purchase and any other relevant observed features

The data used in the project was extracted from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
